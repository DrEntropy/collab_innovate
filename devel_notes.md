## First model

First model July 29 illustrates how innovation rate depends on the network structure and the probability of innovation, but the rate settles down quite quickly.  I may want to have a model that changes the network over time?  Some ideas:

* Add new connections (as discussed previously)

* Kill off innovators that fail too many times 

* Add new innovators to the network  to replace those that fail. Preferentially to the ones with highest success rate?

## Analysis to consider:

* How does the rate of innovation change as we vary the probability of collaboration `p`?

* How does the rate of innovation change as we vary the network structure?

* How does the rate of innovation change as we vary the similarity measure between ideas?

* what is the distribution of innovation success among the innovators?  Is it a power law?
