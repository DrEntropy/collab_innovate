## Collaboration and Innovation

This model is intended to illustrated the impact of collaboration on the rate of innovation. More information is available in the model itself on the info tab. 

This model was built in Netlogo 6.4.
 
## Analysis to consider:

(See also the model's info tab)

* How does the rate of innovation change as we vary the probability of collaboration `p`?

* How does the rate of innovation change as we vary the network structure?

* How does the rate of innovation change as we vary the similarity measure between ideas?

* what is the distribution of innovation success among the innovators?  Is it a power law? How does it depend on the network statistics for that firm? (Centrality, clustering, etc)

* distribution of innovation time  ? How many ticks to succeed?  How does this depend on the firms network statistics?
